![Path of Python](./banner.svg)

A top-down post-apocalyptic ARPG inspired by Path of Exile. Fast, mouse-driven combat with intentionally minimal 2D graphics.

Set in 2300, after a rogue AI collective shattered humanity's golden utopia. Navigate desolate ruins, fight automated constructs, and uncover the mysteries of the "Great Silence."

Harvest Profit Paste from elite enemies to unlock upgrades in your class's paste tree (press P).

**Stalker**

* Singularity Core — all damage has a 5% chance to collapse enemies into a micro-singularity

## Quests

Players fight the Profit Engine, an AI system that harvests humans for Profit Paste and enforces debt slavery through its Tithing Choir. Starting with rescuing a prisoner from processing, quests escalate to hacking corporate grids, raiding caravans, and stealing incriminating ledgers. Sequential, objective-driven missions build toward rebellion against the machine.

## Features

* Real-time combat against AI constructs and corrupted beings
* Status effects: burning, chill, freeze, shock, poison, bleed
* Procedurally generated maps (or hand-drawn with the dungeon generator GUI)
* Environmental storytelling with NPCs like Silas, Bob, Alice, and Charlie
* Stripped-down visuals for performance and clarity

## Install

```
pip install pygame noise==1.2.2
```

`noise` has no prebuilt wheels, so pip compiles it from source. On Windows that requires the [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/); on Linux/macOS a C compiler and Python headers (`python3-dev`).

If you'd rather skip the compiler, just install pygame — the game falls back to a pure-Python noise implementation. Map generation is slower and produces different layouts for the same seed.

## Run

```
python main.py
```
